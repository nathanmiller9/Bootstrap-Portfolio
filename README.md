# Bootstrap-Portfolio

The second portion of week two's homework assignment was to re-create the basic portfolio that we made in week one using primarily bootstrap without explicitly using media queries.  Because I got behind due to the stylized quotation marks on the responsive portfolio, I had to play catch up and work quickly on this one.  As I got more and more into the exercise, I started to become more comfortable with the grid structure and how it fits into the coding.  There's still a lot to learn but I can see how much more quickly and organized the coding process can happen with the help of bootstrap. 

This was a fun exercise and I look forward to working more in bootstrap.
